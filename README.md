## Analysis
There are few quick measures used to get the certain insights:

- #Answered =  CALCULATE(COUNTA('Sheet1'[Call Id]), 'Sheet1'[Answered (Y/N)] IN { "Y" })
- #Resolved = CALCULATE(COUNTA('Sheet1'[Call Id]), 'Sheet1'[Resolved] IN { "Y" })
- #CR = DIVIDE([#Resolved], COUNTA('Sheet1'[Call Id]))
Two new columns are also created:
- Hour : To get the hourly number of calls
- AvgTalkDuration(sec): To get the time average talk duration in seconds 

## Insights
- Average customer satisfaction rating: **3.40**
- Average Speed of Answering          : **67.52 Sec**
- Conversion rate- assign to resolve  : **73%**
- **Agents got least calls at 18th hour**
- **Dane is best performing agent**
